## Setup

Firstly, you must download the required data files. This can be done by executing `make install`, and requires that you have `curl` and `gzip` installed. The files can be removed with `make clean`.

To run `ontology.py`, execute `make run`. You may need to change the definition of `PY` in the makefile before doing this.
